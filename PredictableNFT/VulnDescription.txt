The contract we want to exploit uses known values to generate a "random" 
value used to select the NFT category. There are three categories for this 
NFT, common, rare, and superior. The category is selected depending on the 
hash produced by the NFT id we are minting, the user address launching the
 transaction, and the current block number. Since we know all these values, 
 we can get the hash all of them are producing and mint when the category 
 of NFT is superior.
