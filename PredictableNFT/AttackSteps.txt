This attack just needs three steps:

1. Check how the target SC calculates the NFT category: We don't know the SC 
code in this CTF, but we know its address and the blockchain it is deployed 
on. Then we can go to etherscan and see the SC code. The contract address 
is: 0xFD3CbdbD9D1bBe0452eFB1d1BFFa94C8468A66fC

2. Analyze the decoded code: Once we find the SC, we can decode the 
bytecode and analyze it. We can see the next lines of code in the mint 
function:

if sha3(id, caller, block.number) % 100 > 90:
      tokens[stor0] = 3

And this is what we are interested in: The way we can get an NFT of the
superior class. 

3. Exploit: Now, we can go to our foundry test and program the exploit. 
To do that, we need to get the hash of the NFT id, our address, and the 
current block number. Then we can convert this hash into a number and 
calculate the modulus of 100 of this hash. Finally, we will call the mint 
function if the NFT of our calculated number is greater than 90.
