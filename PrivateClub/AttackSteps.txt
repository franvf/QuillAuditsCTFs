The steps that could be taken to exploit the smart contract could be the next ones:

1. Register our hacker account as a club member: To do this, we must know how many 
members belong to the club. This is to fill the array correctly. E.g., if five 
members belong to the club, we will need to fill the array with five addresses, 
which could be our hacker address this five times. Once we have this array completed,
we can call this function, sending 5 ETH (which will come back to us because we 
filled the full array with our address)

2. Once the user is registered as a member of the club, we can execute a loop to add 
our user over and over again to the club. Then the next user who wants to become a 
member club will run out of gas. 

3. Now we are able to buy the admin role, which allows us to get the control of the 
club. To do this, we need to execute the function buyAdminRole and send 10 ETH to 
the function throughout this function.

4. Once we are owners of the smart contract, we can call the adminWithdraw function, 
which allows us to drain the smart contract. We will execute this function, passing 
our address and the contract balance as parameters. When the function completes, 
we will get the total amount of ETH the contract had.
