This attack consists of getting some voting power without any token.

1. Get voting power from Alice: Alice is an account we can access, which possesses 1000 tokens. 
With these tokens, we can delegate voting power to our hacking account. To do so, we call from 
Alice's account the delegate function, and we will pass our hacker address as a parameter.
Then we can transfer these tokens to Bob's account and repeat this step.

2. Get voting power from Bob: Bob is another account we have access to, who initially possessed 
0 tokens, but we transferred 1000 from Alice to Bob, so now Bob has 1000 tokens. From Bob's 
account, we can call the delegate function and delegate his voting power to our hacker account. 
Therefore, now our hacker account is accumulating 2000 power. After this, Bob will transfer his 
tokens to Carl, the last account we have access to. 

3. Get voting power from Carl. Now that Carl's account has the 1000 tokens, we just need to 
execute the delegate function again to give the power to the hacker account, so this account will
accumulate 3000 voting power, which is enough for our purpose. Finally, we need to transfer 1000 
tokens to the hacker account.
