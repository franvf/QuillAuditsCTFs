Because decentralized exchanges use an AMM (automated market maker) algorithm, which adjusts a 
token's price depending on its liquidity, sometimes getting more or fewer tokens than expected 
is possible due to this price adjustment. If we swap a token with a lot of liquidity for another 
with very low liquidity, we probably get fewer tokens than expected. On the other hand, if we 
swap tokens with very low liquidity for another with a lot of liquidity, we will get more tokens 
than expected.
